 * In undoable mode, the hook dispatches an optimistic action and executes
 * the success side effects right away. Then it waits for a few seconds to
 * actually call the dataProvider - unless the user dispatches an Undo action.
 *
 * We call that "optimistic" because the hook returns a resolved Promise
 * immediately (although it has an empty value). That only works if the
 * caller reads the result from the Redux store, not from the Promise.
