## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-16

### Changed

- Switched API payloads to expose `resource_type` as a human-readable string (e.g., `"WOOD"`) instead of an internal integer ID.
  This change follows best practices discussed in Mark Seemann’s blog, favoring clarity and stability in BFF-style APIs where a frontend is the primary consumer.
